All Docker Containers - Net Container TopBeat - Elastic


0) Convert Docker Daemon running on UNIX Sockets to tcp://0.0.0.0/:<docker_daemon_port>
1) All Docker Containers - This must first be discovered how to do in the best fashion possible.
	- BASH and Docker tools to communicate with API via Docker Commands
	- Ansible - Built-in modules to communicate with Docker API
	- Bash itself to use curl and whatnot to communicate with Docker API
2) Find a way to sidecar in just Docker (--net container:?).
3) Incorperate into TopBeat, ElasticSearch, Kibana
4) Integrate into Kubernetes
5) Write a Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline for the project (deployment into Kubernetes).

Requirements

The below requirements are needed on the host that executes this module.

    Docker API >= 1.20
    Docker SDK for Python: Please note that the docker-py Python module has been superseded by docker (see here for details). For Python 2.6, docker-py must be used. Otherwise, it is recommended to install the docker Python module. Note that both modules should not be installed at the same time. Also note that when both modules are installed and one of them is uninstalled, the other might no longer function and a reinstall of it is required.
    Docker SDK for Python >= 1.8.0 (use docker-py for Python 2.6)
